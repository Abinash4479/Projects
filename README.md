Lumpy skin disease detection of cattles using AI and IOT

Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a viral disease caused by Capripoxvirus, predominantly affecting cattle in 
Africa and the Middle East, with an increasing risk of spreading to Asia and Europe. This disease poses 
significant threats to international trade and has potential as a bioterrorism agent. Various factors such 
as limited vaccine access, economic impacts from COVID-19, sanctions, animal trade, and climate 
change exacerbate its spread. This review encompasses LSD's pathology, transmission, epidemiology, 
diagnosis, and control measures. In response to these challenges, this study focuses on developing a 
comprehensive system for early detection and monitoring of LSD in cattle. Utilizing Arduino technology 
and sensors, a health monitoring device has been designed to track critical parameters such as 
temperature, heart rate, and movement patterns. Complemented by Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs) for image analysis, this system enables early detection of LSD through real-time data collection 
and analysis. The device ensures continuous monitoring and instant alerts, facilitating timely 
interventions and improved livestock management, particularly in remote areas with limited veterinary 
services. This innovative approach aims to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of livestock 
management, thereby reducing the economic and health impacts of LSD and contributing to a more 
resilient agricultural sector
